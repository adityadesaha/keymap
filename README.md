# Ferris Sweep Keymap

This is the keymap for my sweep keyboard


## Interesting things about the keymap
1. It's 34 keys but emulates a whole keyboard and a mouse. With room to spare!!
2. It's got a `REPEAT` key on the right thumb, so no need to press anything twice with the four fingers.
3. The `REPEAT` key has an overloaded tab function: `alt+repeat = alt+tab`, `ctrl+repeat = ctrl+tab`
